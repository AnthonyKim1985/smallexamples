# Spring Boot :: Apache Camel :: Kotlin style

This example shows a very simple application mixing Spring Boot with Apache Camel using Kotlin source code.

## Worth noticing
When you are in Kotlin land you are given string interpolation support...
based on the $ character. Apache Camel loves that as well - so you need to escape it in your `simple expressions. Small stuff though.
You can see that in action in the route builder.
