# Spring Boot :: Apache Camel Mockendpoint

This example shows how Apache Camels `MockEndpoint` can be used - and also a slightly interesting behavior regarding what it "can see".

## Worth noticing
The `MockEndpoint` doesn't copy a reference to the `Exchange` it sees. It is not _the_ `Exchange` ... but rather: a copy of it.
