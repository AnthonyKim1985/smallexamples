= Apache Camel :: How to test that an Exception got handled

This example demonstrates how you can write JUnit tests that verifies if Camel has handled an exception.

Take a look at `MyRouteBuilder`: it allows the caller to control which Exception is thrown.
Pay attention to the `handled(true)` and `handled(false)` variations when the Exceptions are caught.

Finally, check out the result of this behavior on the Exchange  - see `MyRouteBuilderTests`.
