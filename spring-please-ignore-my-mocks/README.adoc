# Spring Framework :: Make Spring ignore your mocks

This example showcase the following problem:

    When you mock a Spring bean in your integration test, and if the mock is based on a class
    and not an interface, then Spring attempts to autowire any dependencies it may have. Spring
    also attempts to invoke any `@PostConstruct` initializers that it may have. But ... you just
    want to mock that d**n bean, right?

See `BadGreeterServiceTests` for a demo of the problem.

See `AwesomeGreeterServiceTests` for the solution to it: Simply wrap your mock inside a `FactoryBean`.
This ensures that Spring doesn't initialize it (performing injection and calling `@PostConstruct` methods).

## Try it out
Run:

    ./gradlew test

Notice that only the test suite approach with a `FactoryBean` works.
