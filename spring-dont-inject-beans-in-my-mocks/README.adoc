# Spring Framework :: Ensuring that Spring doesn't inject beans in your mocks

This example showcase the following problem:

    When you mock a Spring bean in your integration test, and if the mock is based on a class
    and not an interface, then Spring attempts to autowire any dependencies it may have.

    You *just* want to mock it and shouldn't care about any dependencies of the mock, right?

See `BadGreeterServiceTests` for a demo of the problem.

See `AwesomeGreeterServiceTests` for a solution solution to it. The solution is simply to wrap your
mock inside a `FactoryBean`. This ensures that Spring doesn't initialize it (performing injection and
calling `@PostConstruct`.

## Try it out
Run:

    ./gradlew test

Notice that only the test suite approach with a `FactoryBean` works.
